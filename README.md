A browser based phrase hunter game where the player tries to guess a random, hidden phrases using an onscreen keyboard to select letters.

If a player loses the game I added a message displaying the correct answer. 
Using JavaScript, I updated the font color of the game screen, and as the player loses hearts the background color changes to a darker color.
